            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                <i>Yahtzee!</i> is a game that employs both chance and
                strategy. By rolling a set of five 6-sided dice, it is up to you
                how you wish to award your own points based on the combinations
                you roll.

            <h2>Adding/Removing Players</h2>
            <p>
                After starting the application and the splash screen has
                disappeared, you will be greeted with a dialog box with
                a welcome message and an instruction to add all players who
                will play the round. To do so, you must click the large plus
                <b>[+]</b> button on the lower-right side of the dialog box.
                Each player must be entered with a unique name, each of which
                may be up to 15 characters in length, and, due to performance
                limitations (see below for details) up to four players may
                play in each round. Once you are satisfied with your roster,
                you may begin playing by clicking the <i>Play!</i> button.
                Once you do so, the program will generate a score sheet
                containing score slots for every player entered in the roster.
                Generating the score sheet may take a moment, depending on
                the size of the roster and the overall performance of your
                system.

                    <b>What does this mean?</b>
                    Here's a tidbit of information about this notation:
                    
                    <br><br>

                    Let <b>n</b> represent the number of players in the
                    roster. For each player added to the roster, <b>m</b> blank
                    cells are generated in the score sheet, where <b>m</b> is a
                    constant value corresponding to the number of category labels
                    as displayed along the first column of the data table.
                    Since <b>n</b> is a variable and <b>m</b> is a constant, the
                    function representing the time-efficiency of the score sheet
                    initialization process is linear, with a slope of <b>m</b>.
                    The function can be represented as <b>y = mn</b>, which is
                    represented in Big-O notation as <b>O(N)</b>.

                The score sheet will be displayed as a dual-axis table, with
                the first 15 letters of each player's name displayed across
                the first row (which we'll call the &quot;queue&quot;) and the
                category labels displayed along the first column.

            <p>
                A player's turn will be indicated by a light yellow column
                beneath the currently active player's name on the score sheet.
                Once the active player has used his/her turn, it will rotate
                to the next player in the queue. After the last player in the
                queue has used his/her turn, it will return to the first player
                in the queue. This cycle will repeat until every player has
                filled every category in his/her column, at which point the
                game will end and the application will declare the final
                winner(s).

            <h2>Rolling the Dice</h2>
            <p>
                For each turn, the active player will be given three
                opportunities to roll the dice, of which five are provided.
                <b>The number of rolls remaining will be indicated in the
                caption of the <i>Roll</i> button in the dice roller toolbar
                at the top.</b>

                If you see a pattern respective to any of the categories you
                are aiming to fill, you have the beneficial option to hold
                dice to prevent them from being rolled. <b>You can hold or
                unhold a die by clicking on it. A held die is indicated by
                a shaded background color with white dots, while an unheld die
                is indicated by a white background with black dots.</b>

            <h2>Category Selection</h2>
            <p>
                Before concluding one's turn, a player must decide which
                category to fill based on the dice value combination he/she
                has rolled, even if the dice combination does not match any
                available category. More information on how to effectively
                choose a category can be found in the
                <a href="#gameplay-scoring">Scoring</a> section of the
                documentation.

            <p>
                You cannot select a category before using your first roll.
                <b>Once you are ready to select a category or have exhausted
                all your rolls, you can select a category by clicking one of
                the suggested scores that will temporarily appear on the
                score sheet, highlighted in red. Once you have done so, the
                suggestions will disappear and the game will proceed to
                the next turn.

            <h2>Scoring</h2>
            <p>
                Your score tally will depend on your dice value combination
                and what category you select based on that combination. If
                your selected category does not in any way relate to the
                combination you have rolled, a score of zero (0) points will
                be awarded to that category. Each category can only be used
                once per player per round.

            <h1>3. Error Logging</h1>

            <p>
                Albeit rare, there may be some occasions in which the
                application may encounter a fatal error and crash thereafter.
                For instance, because the application attempts to read and
                write data to the disk on which it is running, it may, for
                example, crash in the event that the disk is read-only (such
                as on an SD card with the switch set to read-only mode), out
                of space, suddenly removed from the host system (if the
                storage device is external), or saving to a location where
                write access is restricted due to lack of
                administrator/superuser privileges.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the event of an unhandled program error, the application
                will display a dialog explaining that the application has
                crashed and will show technical details describing the
                cause of the error (this may be useful information for
                developers). You will be given 20 seconds by default to
                either Restart the application or Terminate it, after which
                the application will automatically attempt to restart. You
                may disable the countdown timer by unchecking the <b>Restart
                automatically</b> checkbox if you wish to keep it open.
            </p>

            <p>
                Should you ever be presented with the error dialog, it will
                generate an error log and save it within the local directory
                where the executable is located, under
                <b>\Sidera\Yahtzee\logs</b>. The file will be named with the
                format <b>errorlogYYYYMMDDHHMMSS.txt</b>, with
                <b>YYYYMMDDHHMMSS</b> being the error log's timestamp.
