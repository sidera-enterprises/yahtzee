            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                <i>Yahtzee!</i> is a game that employs both chance and
                strategy. By rolling a set of five cubic dice, it is up to you
                how you wish to award your own points based on the combinations
                you roll.
            </p>
            
            <a name="gameplay-adding-removing-players"></a>
            <h2>Adding/Removing Players</h2>
            <p>
                After you start the application, you will be greeted with a
                dialog box in which you can create your player roster. This
                roster will allow for you to add between 1 to 10 players. Each
                player must be added with a unique screen name. To add a name
                to the roster, press the [<b>+</b>] button to the right of the
                input box; likewise, to remove a name, press the [<b>-</b>]
                button. To begin the game, press the <b>Play!</b> button. The
                application will then generate a score sheet and initialize a
                new game for you.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                NOTE: It may take a moment to generate a score sheet. However,
                the more players you add to your roster, the longer it will
                take for the application to do so.
            </p>
            
            <a name="gameplay-turn-based-gameplay"></a>
            <h2>Turn-Based Gameplay</h2>
            <p>
                The score sheet will be displayed as a dual-axis table, with
                the first five letters of each player's name displayed across
                the first row (which we'll call the &quot;queue&quot;) and the
                category labels displayed along the first column.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A player's turn will be indicated by a light yellow column
                beneath the currently active player's name on the score sheet.
                Once the active player has used his/her turn, it will rotate
                to the next player in the queue. After the last player in the
                queue has used his/her turn, it will return to the first player
                in the queue. This cycle will repeat until every player has
                filled every category in his/her column, at which point the
                game will declare the final winner(s).
            </p>
            
            <a name="gameplay-rolling-the-dice"></a>
            <h2>Rolling the Dice</h2>
            <p>
                For each turn, the active player will be given three
                opportunities to roll the dice, of which five are provided.
                <b>The number of rolls remaining will be indicated in the
                caption of the <i>Roll Dice</i> button in the dice roller
                toolbar at the top.</b>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you see a pattern respective to any of the categories you
                are aiming to fill, you have the beneficial option to hold
                dice to prevent them from being rolled. <b>You can hold or
                unhold a die by clicking on it. A held die is indicated by
                a blue background color with white dots, while an unheld die
                is indicated by a white background with black dots.</b>

            <a name="gameplay-category-selection"></a>
            <h2>Category Selection</h2>
            <p>
                Before concluding one's turn, a player must decide which
                category to fill based on the dice value combination he/she
                has rolled. Information on how to effectively choose a
                category can be found in the
                <a href="#gameplay-scoring">Scoring</a> section of the
                documentation.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                You cannot select a category before using your first roll.
                <b>Once you are ready to select a category or have exhausted
                all your rolls, you can select a category by clicking the
                <i>Category</i> button in the dice roller toolbar at the top.
                A small dialog will appear with a dropdown list of all the
                categories you have not yet used. Click OK to finalize your
                selection.</b>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you are playing in a multiplayer setting, your turn will
                rotate to the next player in the queue once you have selected
                a category.
            </p>

            <h2>Scoring</h2>
            <p>
                Your score tally will depend on your dice value combination
                and what category you select based on that combination. If
                your selected category does not in any way relate to the
                combination you have rolled, a score of zero (0) points will
                be awarded to that category and you will not be able to use
                that category again during the current game.
            </p>
            
            <p>
